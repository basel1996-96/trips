      description:"Marvel at vineyards and apple orchards as far as the eye can see, during the first part of your week of walking. Starting from the well-known spa town of Meran you walk along the South Tyrolean wine route, past historic castles and palaces. Again and again idyllic wine-growing villages along the way invite you to a brief break and to sample the countless South Tyrolean delicacies with wine and apples as staple ingredients. Another highlight of the tour is a detour to the provincial capital Bozen. This town oozes elegance and Italian flair with its quaint arbour alleys and the hussle bussle on the busy square ‚Piazza Walther’. After having experienced this amazing town meanwhile, you finally reach the sunny high plateau  Mölten where you can enjoy the marvellous quiet and nature at its finest! Alpine pastures in full bloom, clear larch forests and grazing cattle, whose milk is turned into delicious specialities there and then. During the whole walking experience you are accompanied by countless panoramic views, for instance, onto the jaggered peaks of the Dolomites, the Sarnthaler Alps, the most fertile Etsch valley or lake Kalterer See."

The nature park ‚Altmühltal’ is also mainly know for its romantic scenery and hence predestined for a comfortable week of walking amidst unspoilt nature. On top of that you come across a landscape steeped in history and culture: impressive ramparts, reconstructed forts and spectacular treasure troves are testimony to Celtic and Roman times. Castles and palaces built by nobility, magnificent churches and monasteries built by prince-archbishops. In the Altmühltal valley you will also enjoy many culinary delights: from tasty sausage specialities all the way to the local hops in the shape of numerous delicious beers.",
